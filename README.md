# NextJs eccomercere app 

#### Hello there 👋 please star this repo if you liked it

### 🔭 This an eccom app backed by apollo-graphql server with express middleware
### 🌱 It uses urql over apollo ( i feel its hard to use ) to fetch data from my graphql api
### ⚡ It's written in  typescript to have a type safe environment 

## 🤔  Why use nextjs ?

- It improves performance 
- You can server side render pages to reduce load on client
- Image optimization is an add on
- There are some special functions like getStatic props etc...

<hr />
